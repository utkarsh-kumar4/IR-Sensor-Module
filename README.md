<h1>🔦 IR Sensor Module</h1>

<p>
This project is a complete IR sensor module designed in <b>KiCad</b>. 
The design process included creating the schematic, drawing the PCB layout, 
and finally generating the 3D board view. The goal was to build a compact 
sensor module that can detect reflected infrared signals and provide a 
digital output.
</p>

<h2>📝 Project Steps</h2>
<p>
1. <b>Schematic Design:</b> The IR LED, photodiode, resistors, potentiometer, 
and LM358 op-amp were connected to form a comparator-based circuit.<br>
2. <b>PCB Layout:</b> The schematic was converted to PCB, components were placed, 
and tracks were routed to ensure proper signal flow.<br>
3. <b>3D Board View:</b> A 3D model of the PCB was generated to visualize 
component placement and final design.
